/* Transition Effects */
/* I gave the nav and id of gameLinks to target each one also put an a tag. I then positioned it and gave the nav text a color of white with a transition color to change different color within a certain amount  of time. I then gave the nav the same id and a tag along
with it, but I also gave it a pusdeo class of hover so each time the user hovers over the text for the nav,  it will then change a different color that was set with an rgb. Using the same nav and id and a tag, I gave it a pseudo class of after and then gave it the styles for each one. This time there is a transition with an opacity and a width with different times in seconds. For the next selector I used, I used the same nav and id and a tag, but gave the a tag a psesudo class of bothe hover and after to combine the two parts with the same opaciity and width.  */

/* Sprite Styles */
/* First, for the div element I gave it a class of sprite to target multiple elements and gave it a position.I put the divs for the
bat, butterfly, and the fox along with thier id of their name. I then gave each one a different width, hieght, and background for when they appear of the web page.
I animation is for each character to move at differnt time intervals and gave them a the same name with an infinite movement.  */
